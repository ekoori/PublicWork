| LTE     | In the context of networking, "LTE" stands for "Long Term Evolution." It's a standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals, based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies. LTE increases the capacity and speed of wireless data networks using new DSP (Digital Signal Processing) techniques and modulations. It's widely used for mobile internet access and is the basis for 4G wireless communications standards. |
