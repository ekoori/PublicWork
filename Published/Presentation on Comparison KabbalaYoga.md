# Presentation on Comparison Kabbala/Yoga


## Opening Thesis

- Aim: Present two contemplative maps—Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras and Kabbalah—as complementary lenses on reality, practice, and transformation.
- Frame: Both describe how consciousness distorts and how disciplined practice reveals the Real; their goals differ—Yoga seeks kaivalya (liberation/aloneness of Purusha), Kabbalah seeks devekut (cleaving to the Divine) and tikkun (repair).

---

## Patanjali Snapshot

- Text: 195 aphorisms in 4 chapters (Samadhi, Sadhana, Vibhuti, Kaivalya), 2nd–4th c. CE.
- Core Claim (I.2): “Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of mind.”
- Key Terms: Purusha (seer), Prakriti (nature), citta-vritti (mental waves), klesha (affliction), samskara (imprint), ashtanga (eight limbs), samadhi (absorption), kaivalya (liberation).

---

## Kabbalah Snapshot

- Divine: Ein Sof (Infinite), Or (Light), Sefirot (10 emanations), Shekhinah (immanent presence).
- Cosmos: Four Worlds—Atzilut (Emanation), Beriah (Creation), Yetzirah (Formation), Asiyah (Action).
- Human: Five soul levels—Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chayah, Yechidah.
- Dynamics: Tzimtzum (contraction), Shevirat HaKelim (shattering), Tikkun (repair), Devekut (cleaving), Kavvanah (intent).

---

## Core Parallels

- Mind & Distortion: Citta-vritti ↔ Klipot (husks) and scattered consciousness; both veil the Real.
- Witnessing: Purusha (seer) ↔ Point of Yechidah (unitary soul-root); both untouched by flux.
- Manifest Nature: Prakriti’s evolutes ↔ Sefirotic flow across Four Worlds; layered reality from subtle to gross.
- Goal: Kaivalya (seer rests in own nature) ↔ Devekut/Yichud (union of Holy One and Shekhinah); different language for stabilized God-consciousness.
- Means: Abhyasa/Vairagya (practice/dispassion) ↔ Kavvanah/Bitul (intention/ego-surrender); steadying attention and unclinging.

---

## Ashtanga ↔ Kabbalah (1)

- Yama (restraints): Non-harm, truth, non-stealing ↔ Ethical mitzvot, derekh eretz, Musar refinement of middot.
- Niyama (observances): Purity, contentment, devotion ↔ Taharah, simchah, bitachon, “serving with joy,” cleaving to Divine will.
- Asana: Steady, easeful posture ↔ Body as kli (vessel) fit for light; sanctifying physicality.
- Pranayama: Regulating breath/energy ↔ Nishmat chayim (Divine breath), Ruach; breath as bridge Nefesh↔Ruach.

---

## Ashtanga ↔ Kabbalah (2)

- Pratyahara: Sense withdrawal ↔ Tzimtzum-like inwardness; hitbodedut (seclusion) to quiet sensory pull.
- Dharana: One-pointed focus ↔ Kavvanah on a sefirah, Divine Name, or intention.
- Dhyana: Effortless continuity ↔ Hitbonenut/expanded mochin (mature consciousness); sustained God-thought.
- Samadhi: Nondual absorption ↔ Devekut (cleaving); self-transparency to Divine presence.
- Ishvara-Pranidhana: Surrender to the Lord ↔ Bitul ha-yesh (self-nullification) and trust in Divine Providence.

---

## Cosmos & Mind

- Sheaths ↔ Souls: Five koshas (sheaths) ↔ Five soul levels; both grade awareness from bodily to transpersonal.
- Subtle Maps: Chakras (7) ↔ Sefirot (10)/Tree of Life; both ladders of ascent, not one-to-one correspondences.
- Light & Waves: Vritti as ripples in citta ↔ Or filtered through kelim; clarity when vessel is pure and still.

---

## "Filling the Vessels" in Yoga

- Kabbalah: Or (Divine light) filling rectified kelim after tikkun.
- Closest parallel: prana saturating purified nadis/chakras (Hatha/Tantra).
- Patanjali emphasis: citta stillness; clarified buddhi lit by ritambhara prajna (I.47–I.48).
- Ojas/tejas/sattva: conserved/refined vitality pervades the system via tapas and brahmacarya.
- Dharma-megha samadhi (IV.29–IV.31): cloud of dharma "rains" knowledge; afflictions cease.
- Bhakti stream: Isvara-pranidhana and grace "filling" the heart.
- Caution: Different ontologies; strongest parallels in Hatha/Tantra rather than strict classical Yoga.

---

## Obstacles & Purification

- Kleshas (Avidya, Asmita, Raga, Dvesha, Abhinivesha): Root ignorance and ego-clinging ↔ Yetzer hara, selfing, attachment; klipot obscuring light.
- Samskara/Karma: Conditioned grooves ↔ Reshimu (imprint), tikkun hanefesh (soul repair) through repeated right action.
- Kriya Yoga (Tapas, Svadhyaya, Ishvara-Pranidhana): Heat, self-study, surrender ↔ Mussar discipline, Torah inwardization, Devekut.

---

## Sound & Language

- Pranava (OM): Seed sound of reality ↔ Shem Havayah (Tetragrammaton) and Divine Names.
- Mantra/Japa: Vibration aligns mind ↔ Letter-combination meditation (Abulafia) and Name-focus with kavvanot.

---

## Ethics & Community

- Non-harm (Ahimsa): Personal restraint ↔ Pikuach nefesh and chesed; repair in community.
- Truth (Satya): Right speech ↔ Emes; speech as vessel for light (lashon hakodesh discipline).

---

## Suggested Opening Script

“Two traditions, two roadmaps. Patanjali says: Yoga is stilling the mind so the seer rests in its own nature. Kabbalah says: Reality is Divine light descending through vessels; our task is to repair and cleave back to its source. Tonight we’ll read these as parallel practices: steadying attention (abhyasa/kavvanah), releasing grasping (vairagya/bitul), and embodying ethics so the vessel can hold light (yama–niyama/mitzvot). We won’t force a one-to-one mapping; instead we’ll notice recurring patterns—contraction, alignment, absorption, and repair—across both maps.”

## Slide Flow

- Thesis: Two maps; different goals, shared methods.
- Patanjali 101: Structure, I.2, I.3, II.29, IV.34.
- Kabbalah 101: Ein Sof, Sefirot, Four Worlds, Devekut/Tikkun.
- Mind & Obstructions: Vritti/klesha ↔ Klipot; practical implications.
- Eight Limbs Overview: One line each with Kabbalah parallels.
- Breath & Attention: Pranayama ↔ Ruach; Dharana/Dhyana ↔ Kavvanah/Hitbonenut.
- Samadhi & Devekut: Similar tastes; distinct metaphysics.
- Ethics as Technology: Yama/niyama ↔ Mitzvot/Musar.
- Subtle Maps: Koshas/soul-levels; Chakras/Tree of Life (caution slide).
- Integration: Daily practice stack that honors both.
- Q&A: Boundaries and respectful synthesis.

---

## Practical Integration

- Morning: 10 min pranayama + simple kavvanah on chesed/gevurah balance.
- Midday: Dharana on breath or Name (silently), 5–10 min.
- Evening: Svadhyaya (text study) + brief hitbodedut; review one middah.
- Weekly: Service/charity aligned with ahimsa/chesed to “polish the vessel.”

---

## Cautions

- Non-Equivalence: Avoid flattening differences; kaivalya ≠ yichud, Purusha ≠ Ein Sof.
- Context: Keep practices within each tradition’s ethical/theological frame.
- Language: Use parallels as metaphors, not strict identities.

---

## Key Passages to Quote

- Yoga Sutra: I.2–I.3 (citta-vritti-nirodhah), II.1–II.3 (kriya yoga, kleshas), II.29 (eight limbs), III.3 (samadhi), IV.34 (kaivalya).
- Kabbalistic Sources: Sefer Yetzirah (structures), Zohar (Shekhinah/Devekut), Etz Chaim (Lurianic tzimtzum/shevirah/tikkun), Sefer Tanya (bitul/devekut in practice).

---

## Visuals

- Dual Ladder: Eight limbs on one side; Tree of Life on the other; arrows showing “refine vessel → focus → union/liberation.”
- Wave/Light Metaphor: Agitated water vs. still water reflecting light; vessel before/after polishing.

---

## Closing Takeaways

- Shared Pattern: Contraction, alignment, sustained attention, ethical refinement, absorption.
- Distinct Ends: Liberation into the seer’s nature vs. union and repair of Divine presence.
- Actionable Path: Small, consistent practices that calm the mind and brighten the vessel.
